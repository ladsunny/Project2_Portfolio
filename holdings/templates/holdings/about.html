    <p>Hi, I am Nishant Sharma, and I am a retail investor. I have been investing in US stock market since 2003, however, I really became passionate about it in 2010. Typically, I invest in stocks of large US based companies that are publicly traded. And, I usually take a long-term view (1-5 years) when investing in these companies. </p>
    <br />
    <p>I am not a professional investment advisor, and I do not consider myself as an expert either. However, I take a lot of pride in managing my own stocks portfolio. It is a great feeling to be in full control of my investments, and to perform better than the benchmark. </p>
    <br />
    <p>Based on my experience in trading stocks for more than 15 years, I have come to believe that an investor does not need to be a wizard to be successful in the stock market, especially when investing in great companies for long-term. So, the idea is to keep it simple, and to not become impatient or greedy.</p>
    <br />
    <p>Sidewithstocks.com is just another way for me to extend my passion for investing in stocks. It compels me to be more thoughtful about my investment decisions, and provides me a customized source of reference to better manage my stocks portfolio. </p>
