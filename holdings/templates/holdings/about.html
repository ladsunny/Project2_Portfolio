    <p>Hi,</p>
    <p>I am a retail investor, and I have been trading stocks in US market since 2003. I manage my own equity portfolio, and my simple objective is to achieve better rate of return than my retirement accounts (IRA/401k) on a consistent basis for long term. I really enjoy the process of following publicly traded companies, and investing in them through preferred & common stocks.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>This website (Sidewithstocks.com) is just another way for me to extend my passion for investing in stocks, and to share my views & trades with other retail investors. However, please do not consider information shared on the website as professional investment advise, or, as recommendation to buy/sell something.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>Thanks,</p>
    <p>N.Sharma</p>
