    <p>Hello! My name is Nishant Sharma, I am a retail investor, and owner of sidewithstocks.com. I have been investing in the US stock market since 2003. Usually, I like to invest in stocks of large US based companies, and I take a long-term view (1-5 years) when investing in these companies. I am not a professional investment advisor, and I do not consider myself as an expert either. However, I take a lot of pride in managing my own stock portfolio. Sidewithstocks.com is just another way for me to extend my passion for investing in stocks. It compels me to be more thoughtful about my investment decisions, and provides me a customized source of reference to track my trading actions.</p>
