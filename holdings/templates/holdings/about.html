    <p>Hi,</p>
    <p>I am a retail investor, trading equities in US markets since 2003. I manage my own equity portfolio, and my simple objective is to achieve better rate of return than my retirement accounts (IRA/401k) on a consistent basis for long term. I am not a professional investment analyst or advisor, but I enjoy the process of reviewing publicly traded companies, and investing in them through preferred & common stocks.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>Sidewithstocks.com is just another way for me to extend my passion for investing in stocks, and to share my views & trades with other retail investors. However, please note that the information shared on this website is not investment advise or recommendations.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>Thanks,</p>
    <p>N.Sharma</p>
