    <p>Hi, welcome to sidewithstocks.com! My name is Nishant Sharma. I am a retail investor, and I have been trading stocks in US market since 2003. My objective is to gradually build a strong portfolio of stocks, and achieve a better rate of return than S&P 500 index. I am not a professional investment advisor, and I do not consider myself as an expert either. However, I take a lot of pride in managing my own stock portfolio. Sidewithstocks.com is just another way for me to extend my passion for investing in stocks. It compels me to be more thoughtful about my investment decisions, and provides me a customized source of reference to track my recent trades.</p>
