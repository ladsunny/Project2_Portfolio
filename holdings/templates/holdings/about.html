    <p>Hi, my name is Nishant Sharma. Investing in stocks is one of my favorite activities. Although I have been investing in US stock market since 2003, I really became passionate about it in 2010. Primarily, I like to invest in stocks of large US based companies that are publicly traded. And, I usually take a long-term view (1-5 years) when investing in these companies.</p>
    <br />
    <p>I am by no means an expert when it comes to stocks and investing. However, I strongly believe that I don't need to be a wizard to be successful with stocks. Instead, I need to be passionate, careful, patient, & persistent.</p>
    <br />
    <p>Currently, I manage my stock portfolio using basic tools such as Microsoft Excel, publicly available financial & market data, and a brokerage account. However, my current portfolio includes companies from multiple industries and sectors, and I am usually tracking performance of more than 100 companies on a regular basis.</p>
    <br />
    <p>Sidewithstocks.com is just another way for me to extend my passision with stocks. It compels me to be more thoughful about my investment decisions. It also provides me an alternate & customized source of reference. And, I expect that the information consolidated on this site will help me become a better investor.</p>
